## 📋 Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How does this compare to traditional fraud detection?**
A: Traditional methods look at individual transactions. Our graph approach models relationships between entities, detecting patterns like fraud rings that individual analysis misses.

**Q: What's the performance compared to industry standards?**
A: Our 85%+ AUC-ROC is competitive with industry solutions. More importantly, we detect organized fraud rings which traditional methods struggle with.

**Q: How scalable is this system?**
A: The architecture is production-ready with REST API, proper testing, and documentation. It can scale horizontally with load balancing and database integration.

**Q: What makes the visualizations special?**
A: Interactive Plotly dashboards allow real-time exploration of fraud patterns, entity relationships, and risk distributions - much more insightful than static reports.

**Q: How do you handle false positives?**
A: Multi-factor risk scoring combines transaction-level, entity-level, and graph-level signals. The system provides risk levels (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL) rather than just binary classification.

**Q: What about real-time performance?**
A: Sub-200ms API response times make it suitable for real-time transaction processing. The graph structure allows efficient neighbor sampling for fast inference.
